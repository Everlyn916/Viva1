# Viva1 Repository

Welcome to the **Viva1** repository\! This guide will show a beginner how to download (clone) a complete copy of this project to your local computer using **Git** and the **command line**.

-----

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you begin, you need to have **Git** installed on your computer. Git is the tool that allows your computer to communicate with GitHub.

  * **Check if Git is installed:** Open your terminal (or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows) and type the following command:
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```
    If you see a version number (e.g., `git version 2.30.0`), you're all set\! If not, please download and install Git from the official website: [Git SCM](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## How to Clone the Repository (Beginner's Guide) ⬇️

"Cloning" means creating a complete, local copy of all the files and history from this GitHub repository.

### Step 1: Open Your Terminal/Command Prompt

Open your computer's command line interface:

  * **macOS/Linux:** Use **Terminal**
  * **Windows:** Use **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**

### Step 2: Navigate to the Desired Folder

Use the `cd` (change directory) command to move into the location where you want to save the project folder.

  * **Example:** To go to a folder called `Projects` on your Desktop:
    ```bash
    cd Desktop/Projects 
    ```
    (Tip: If the folder doesn't exist, you can create it first using `mkdir Projects`.)

### Step 3: Run the Clone Command

Once you are in the correct folder, execute the following command. This command uses the specific URL for the **Viva1** repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/123EFD/Viva1
```

### Step 4: Verification

After the command runs successfully, you will see a message confirming the cloning process. You will now have a new folder named `Viva1` in the directory you selected in Step 2.

  * You can navigate into the new folder:
    ```bash
    cd Viva1
    ```
  * You now have all the project files locally and are ready to start working\!
